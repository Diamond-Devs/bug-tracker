# Diamond Devs Bug Tracker

This is a bug tracker for our web development collective, Diamond Devs. The Front End will be done by fromjaytoz and the back end will be done by rileydlynch. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

-React

-styled-components

-node.js

-MongoDB


# What we've done so far (VISUALIZATION)

This is a new project, but we are progressing relatively quickly. The login page and sign-up pages are 98% finished. Next is the dashboard.

WHAT WE AIM TO ACCOMPLISH:

-Dashboard, Authentication, Ticket System

-CRUD features typical for an enterprise bug tracker application

-To teach and observe each other's strengths (we are both good at the other's weakness)

-Beautiful animations

-A new UI Library (I want to make a small UI library for Diamond Devs to use in the future)

<b>MINIMUM Login/Signup Page UI (95% completed)</b>
