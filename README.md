# Diamond Devs Bug Tracker

This is a bug tracker for our web development collective, Diamond Devs. The Front End will be done by fromjaytoz and the back end will be done by rileydlynch. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
React
styled-components
node.js
MongoDB

# What we've done so far (VISUALIZATION)
This is a new project, but we are progressing relatively quickly. The login page and sign-up pages are 98% finished. Next is the dashboard.

WHAT WE AIM TO ACCOMPLISH:
Dashboard
CRUD features
To teach and observe each other's strengths (we are both good at the other's weakness)
Beautiful animations
A new UI Library (I want to make a small UI library for Diamond Devs to use in the future)
